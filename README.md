## About pfoject

This is a simple demo home page app where I use _tailwindCSS_ for the first time.

I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

next run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
